This code uses an esp8266 to connect an DHT, HC-SR04, and moisture sensor together, publishing it to a LAN server that when connected to displays the data.
Overall very simple, requiring DHT.h library with prerequisites, also the ESP8266 library.
ignore opti2
also be careful it fucking melted itself
